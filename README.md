To watch demo - https://youtu.be/391aP798mWk

## Introduction
This documentation presents an overview of an IoT-based accident prevention system built using Arduino and NodeMCU. The system utilizes multiple sensors, such as ultrasound and LIDAR, to detect the distance between vehicles and prevent accidents from occurring. It incorporates features like alert notifications via email and SMS in case of an accident or a close save. Additionally, the system includes automatic control over brakes, achieved by controlling motors to stop vehicles when the threshold distance limit between vehicles is crossed.

## System Architecture
The IoT-based accident prevention system consists of the following key components:

1. **Arduino**: Arduino is used as the microcontroller to control the overall system. It interfaces with various sensors, processes the sensor data, and controls the motors for brake activation.

2. **NodeMCU**: NodeMCU, an open-source firmware and development board based on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, is employed for IoT connectivity. It enables the system to communicate with external services like email and SMS gateways.

3. **Ultrasound Sensor**: An ultrasound sensor is utilized to measure the distance between the vehicle and its surroundings. It emits ultrasonic waves and calculates the time taken for the waves to bounce back after hitting an obstacle.

4. **LIDAR Sensor**: A LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor is employed to obtain highly accurate distance measurements. It uses laser light to calculate distances based on the time-of-flight principle.

5. **Motor**: Motors are integrated into the braking system of the vehicle to activate the brakes automatically when necessary.

6. **Internet Connectivity**: The NodeMCU module enables the system to connect to the internet, allowing it to send notifications and receive commands from external services.

## System Workflow

1. **Sensor Data Acquisition**: The Arduino collects data from the ultrasound and LIDAR sensors to measure the distance between the vehicle and other objects in its surroundings.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The collected sensor data is processed to calculate the actual distance between the vehicle and nearby obstacles or vehicles.

3. **Threshold Comparison**: The calculated distance is compared with a predefined threshold value. If the distance falls below the threshold, it indicates a potential accident situation.

4. **Alert Generation**: In case of an accident or a close save, the system triggers an alert. It uses the NodeMCU module to send notifications via email and SMS to the user, providing them with real-time information about the situation.

5. **Brake Activation**: When the threshold limit for the distance between vehicles is crossed, the system activates the motors connected to the braking system, effectively stopping the vehicle to prevent a collision.

## Best Practices

During the development of the IoT-based accident prevention system, the following best practices were followed:

1. **Safety Considerations**: The system was designed with utmost consideration for safety, ensuring that the braking mechanism is reliable and effective in preventing accidents.

2. **Modular Code**: The system's code was divided into reusable and modular components, promoting code readability, maintainability, and reusability. This allows for easier troubleshooting and future enhancements.

3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling techniques were implemented to handle exceptional situations, such as network connectivity issues, sensor failures, or system malfunctions. Error messages or notifications were logged to aid in debugging.

4. **Code Optimization**: The code was optimized for efficient execution and memory utilization. This includes avoiding blocking operations, using appropriate data structures, and optimizing algorithms wherever possible.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing and validation processes were employed to ensure the system's accuracy, reliability, and robustness. It involved testing the sensor readings, network connectivity, alert generation, and brake activation functionality.

6. **Documentation**: Thorough documentation was created, including circuit diagrams, pin configurations,

 code explanations, and usage instructions. This documentation facilitates future maintenance, troubleshooting, and knowledge sharing.
